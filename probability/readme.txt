The solutions to questions 12-17 are written in Python. (Files of the form question1X.py).
There are also these helper modules (files):
experiment.py - Random experiments for each distribution (only those relevant to the questions)
probability.py - PMFs for each distribution
util.py - General utilities

Inside the simulation_results folder there's a sample output for each question.
*Please note that the solutions require Python 3.6+ (preferably 3.7+).
